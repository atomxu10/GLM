Road traffic accidents (RTAs) in the United Kingdom are a persisting problem which continues to cause severe injuries and incur high costs despite government efforts to aviod them. This analysis investigates the relationship between accident severity and speed limit using data from the UKâ€™s Department for Transport on RTAs in 2020 while also considering other variables that may affect this relationship.

The report will present findings from the data analysis and show that higher speed limits contribute to the severity of accidents. In addition, it will show that multiple other factors affect the accident severity. As such, a lasting solution to the severity of RTAs will entail a multifaceted approach where the speed limit is only part of the solution.
