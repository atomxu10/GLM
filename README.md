# Invstigation of the effect of speed limit on the severity of road traffic accidents in the UK 2020 ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-R-blue)


Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a significant and ongoing problem in the United Kingdom. In 2020, 91,199 reported road accidents resulted in 19,746 serious or fatal injuries and 71,453 slight injuries, devastating consequences for those involved, their families, and society.

It continues to cause severe injuries and incur high costs despite government efforts to avoid them. This analysis investigates the relationship between accident severity and speed limit using data from the UKâ€™s Department for Transport on RTAs in 2020 while also considering other variables that may affect this relationship.

The report will present findings from the generalized linear model and show that higher speed limits contribute to the severity of accidents.
