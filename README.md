# Investigation of the effect of speed limit on the severity of road traffic accidents in the UK 2020 ![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-R-blue)


Road traffic accidents (RTAs) are a significant and ongoing problem in the United Kingdom. In 2020, 91,199 reported road accidents resulted in 19,746 serious or fatal injuries and 71,453 slight injuries, devastating consequences for those involved, their families, and society.

It continues to cause severe injuries and incur high costs despite government efforts to avoid them. This analysis investigates the relationship between accident severity and speed limit using data from the UKâ€™s Department for Transport on RTAs in 2020 while also considering other variables that may affect this relationship.

The report will present findings from the generalized linear model and show that higher speed limits contribute to the severity of accidents.

## Method
### Data
The data utilized in this analysis consists of three different datasets published by the [DfT](https://github.com/atomxu10/GLMProject/tree/main/data), namely Accidents, Vehicles, and Casualties, each providing a detailed account of different aspects of road accidents. The datasets provide a comprehensive and detailed understanding of the factors contributing to road accidents, including the characteristics of vehicles, drivers, casualties, driving conditions, and road features.

The Accidents dataset provides information on accident severity, speed limit, location, driving conditions, and casualties involved in each incident. It includes 36 variables, covering many details, such as light conditions, weather conditions, hazards, and police attendance.

The Vehicles dataset covers 27 variables that provide a detailed account of the vehicles and drivers involved in each accident. It includes information on the type of vehicle, manoeuvre performed during the accident, driver age and sex, the vehicle makes and model, fueling system, and engine capacity. The dataset has multiple rows of data per accident reference number, each representing a different vehicle involved in the accident.

The Casualties dataset includes 18 variables that convey information on the casualties involved in each accident. It contains details on the age and sex of each casualty, whether they were a pedestrian or in a vehicle. Their movement and location during the accident are also included if they were pedestrians. The dataset has multiple rows of data per accident reference number, each representing a different casualty involved in the accident.
